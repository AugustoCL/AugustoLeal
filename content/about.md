title: About me
---

I'm an Actuarial Analyst in [Zurich Seguros S.A](https://www.zurich.com/), graduated in [Actuarial Science](https://www.beanactuary.org/) and an eternal curious about all topics related to data. I aim to be able to solve many types of problems using different quantitative methods available. That's why I use and study different subjects and tools, without any preference for them. 

Here you will find posts on different subjects:  

* Data Science
* Machine Learning
* Mathematical Optimization
* Statistics
* Actuarial Sciences
* Finance
* WebScraping
* Data Viz
* and so on...

Recently, I have been solving my problems with different languages. This blog, for example, was made in **R** with `Blogdown`, but many other posts I will use **Julia**, **Python** and any other language that is better suited to the problem or that I be interested at the moment :satisfied:

All the codes present in the posts you will find also available on [my Github](https://github.com/AugustoCL). If you want to get in touch with me, go to the [contact page](../contact) and send me a message.
